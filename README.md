# Shopp App with stored data
Our company KILLMIND has improved our shopping app and now we can retrieve and store the products in a remote database throrugh using an API.

Please, modify your client code according to the requirements.

## Requirement 1: Retrieve all the products from database
Bob, our devops, tell us that we have an API address where we can perform a GET to retrieve all the products from the database. The exact URL with its endpoint is:

```
http://ec2-35-181-5-201.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/list-products/:idTeam
```

__idTeam__ is the codename assigned to you

You must retrieve all the data from the API and display the products.

## Requirement 2: Fix the product title in the database
You have realized that the last of the records you are retrieving is not well-formed. There's a field with a wrong name. It should be _title_ instead of _titre_

You ask Bob to fix it as it is his job but he replies:

> Please, do it yourself, I am too busy at the moment.

Bob give us a PEM key in order to access to the server:

> Just save it to a PEM file to connect to our server. Once there, find a **file** with a **JSON** format, and fix the JSON field with any text editor. Please, fix only **the file of your team**. Others maybe upset if you mess up something that is not yours.

Bob also reminds you how to connect to our server:

```
ssh -i "file.pem" singulars2021@ec2-35-181-5-201.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## Requirement 3: Do not display products that are going to be released later than this year
Some of the products (one only, to be precise) may be released later than the current year. Modify your code to **not display** the products that are going to be released in the future.


## Requirement 4: Add new products

Now went to be able to also add new products to the database. Please, modify your code so, when a new product is added in the form, it is inserted in the database. This [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-and-post-method-using-fetch-api/) maybe helpful

The endpoint to add a new product is:

```
http://http://ec2-35-181-5-201.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/add-product/:idTeam
```

You must perform a POST method to this endpoint. Have a look at the response of this AJAX call: ii may contain important information

## Requirement 5: Bob's petition
> Buddy, please, add for me this product:

* Title: "The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe".
* Price: 5.25
* Year: 1960

Can you add this product? Why not? What could you do in your client application? What are you going to tell Bob?

## BONUS Requirement
Implement now the DELETE functionality.

The endpoint to remove a product is:

```
http://http://ec2-35-181-5-201.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/add-product/:idTeam/:idProduct
```

Where __idTeam__ is your codename, and __idProduct__ is the unique id provided by the API when we add a new product

Good Luck! :four_leaf_clover:
